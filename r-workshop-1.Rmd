# R and RStudio Basics

This is an RMarkdown document. RMarkdown can be used to create a variety of outputs (e.g. reports), but for now we will be using it as a way to document our data analysis. 

You can type text surrounding code chunks, as you would in a word document.

```{r}
# This is a code chunk. Within code chunks, you can type R code to execute operations.

# When typing R code, you may also wish to insert comments to annotate your code (like this one!). You can do this simply by starting a line with the "#" sign

# To execute code from a code chunk, either select the lines of code and press "Run" in the toolbar, or press "Ctrl/Cmd + Enter" on your keyboard

# Try running the following lines of code
1 + 1

```
