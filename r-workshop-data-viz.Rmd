So far, you've been using functions included in base R, but there are many more R packages that contain additional useful functions for various tasks. One such package is ggplot2, which is a very popular data visualization package.


# Packages

## Installing ggplot2 package

```{r}
# To install R packages (works for most packages)

install.packages("package_name") # Note that the package_name is wrapped in double quotes. This is important.

# Try installing the ggplot2 package

install.packages("ggplot2")
```

You only need to install packages once on any given computer.

## Loading ggplot2

Once you've installed the ggplot2 package, in order to access the package's functions, you would need to load the package. In contrast to installation, this needs to be done every time you open and re-open R.

```{r}
# To load an R package, use the library() function

# Try loading the ggplot2 package

library(ggplot2)

# Once you've loaded the package, you can now access the package contents

```


# The iris dataset

For the following data visualization exercises, we will use the built-in "iris" dataset. 

```{r}
# Load the data
data(iris)

# Brief summary of the data
summary(iris)

```

# Data visualization with ggplot2

## Visualizing univariate distributions

```{r}
# Univariate continuous distributions can be visualized in various ways, but one popular way is a histogram


# Let's create a basic histogram of the sepal length variable from the iris dataset using ggplot2

ggplot(data = iris, # Specify the name of the dataset
       aes(x = Sepal.Length)) + # Specify which variable to map to the x-axis
  geom_histogram() # Add a geom_histogram layer to create a histogram of sepal length


# Try adapting the previous code to create a histogram of the sepal width





```

## Visualizing relationships between two continuous variables

Relationships between two continuous variables are commonly visualized using a scatterplot. 

```{r}

# Create a basic scatterplot to show the relationship between sepal length and petal length

ggplot(data = iris,
       aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point() # geom_point creates points at each x-y mapping of the data, thereby creating a scatterplot


```

## Visualizing relationships between a continuous variable and a discrete variable

Relationships between continuous and discrete variables are trickier to visualize. One common way is to use boxplots.

```{r}

# Create a simple boxplot of sepal length by flower species 

ggplot(data = iris,
       aes(x = Species, # Note: for boxplots, you should put the discrete variable on the x-axis
           y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot()


```

## Faceting visualizations to show conditional relationships

Sometimes, it's helpful to see conditional relationships between variables. This can be done by using facet helper functions in ggplot2 to create "paneled" plots.

```{r}

# Using faceting, visualize the relationship between sepal length and petal length, conditioned by flower species

ggplot(data = iris,
       aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(c("Species"))

```
