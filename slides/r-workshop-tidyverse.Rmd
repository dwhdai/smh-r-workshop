# Welcome to the SMH R Workshop Series!

### Workshop 1- Data visualization and data manipulation in the R Tidyverse 
* Workshop materials [here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/256912)

### Workshop 2- R in the life of a researcher (March 26, 11:00AM, Eyesha Hashim)

### Workshop 3- Statistical analysis with R (April 23, 12:00PM, Charles Keown-Stoneman)

# Goals of today

## 1) Learn the basics of modern R programming
## 2) Create simple data visualizations using ggplot2
## 3) Learn the basics of data manipulation using dplyr

### I will assume that you have some knowledge/experience of programming.

# During the workshops...

### There will be a few of us in the room who can help with any technical difficulties.

## 1) If you have any technical difficulties, please flag one of us down and we'll be happy to help.

## 2) If you have any questions related to the content, please stop me at any time!

# What is R?

- R is a free statistical programming language
- R is open source, and R packages are created by the community
- Many R packages are built for data analysis 
- R is **flexible** and **rapidly developing**
- R can be downloaded [here](https://www.r-project.org/)

---

## RStudio

- RStudio is a company that created the RStudio IDE (integrated development environment) for R
- The RStudio IDE is a great tool for doing data analysis in R
- RStudio can be downloaded freely [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

---

## Tidyverse

- One of the challenges with learning R is the lack of consistency between packages
- The tidyverse is a suite of packages developed by RStudio to help create a more unified R experience

# R for Data Science

Today's workshop will highlight a lot of concepts originated from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
